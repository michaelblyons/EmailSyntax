# EmailSyntax
`.tmLanguage` syntax highlighting for `.eml` files.

I discovered by accident that [Kate][] had syntax highlighting for emails in their raw format, and decided that'd be a nice thing for the text editors that I use. I expected that someone had already made a `.tmLanguage` for it, but after poking around the internet for the third or fourth time, I only found people like myself _asking_ about whether one existed.

So I started on one. It's not great, but I decided to check it in before I start on [splitting the email into regions with their own syntax][iss4].

## How you can help
